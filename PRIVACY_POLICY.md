Effective Date: [01/09/2025]

Thank you for choosing TRICINTY ("we," "us," "our"). This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how your data is handled when you use our mobile application, TRICINTY (the "App").

Your privacy is our highest priority. The core principle of TRICINTY is to provide a powerful tool without compromising your personal data.

1. The Core Principle: Your Data is Yours
TRICINTY is designed to work entirely offline. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal information or usage data. All the information you enter into the App is stored exclusively on your own device.

2. Information You Provide
When you use TRICINTY, you may enter the following types of data:
Electricity Meter Readings: The kWh values and the corresponding dates and times you input. This data is used solely to perform calculations for your consumption, bill estimates, and historical trends within the App.
Settings and Preferences: This includes your preferred theme (light/dark), language, currency symbol, electricity tariff rates, and monthly spending goal. This information is used only to customize your experience and ensure the accuracy of calculations performed on your device.
This data is stored locally in your browser's or device's storage and is never sent to us or any third party. If you clear the App's data from your device or browser settings, all of this information will be permanently deleted.

3. Information We Do Not Collect
To be perfectly clear, we DO NOT collect any of the following:
Personal Information: Your name, email address, phone number, location, or any other personally identifiable information.
Device Information: Your device's unique identifiers, IP address, operating system, or browser type.
Usage Analytics: We do not track how you use the app, which buttons you click, or how often you open it.

4. Data Storage and Security
All data you enter into TRICINTY is stored on your device's local storage. This means you have full control over your data. The security of this data is dependent on the security of your own device. We do not have access to it at any time.

5. Third-Party Services
The App loads certain standard web libraries (such as React and TailwindCSS) from reputable public Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to function. These services do not receive any personal data you enter into the App. Their purpose is only to provide the necessary code for the App's user interface.

6. Children's Privacy
TRICINTY is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
